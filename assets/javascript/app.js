var score = 0;

// make a for loop that goes through the different questions

console.log (question);
// have a time limit for about 15 sec
// if they get the answer right then their score goes up by 1 and shows the gif of the correct answer 
// but if they get it wrong then their score  stays as zero and shows the correct answer and alerts better luck next time
